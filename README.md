# Sprint 0 - Paper tower

For our first sprint we will be practicing the process of design, and submission of sprints using Github.

You will document and submit your design process in this GitHub repository. Your design process will involve all of the stages that you will show in each stage of our RoboCup project, but for this first sprint we will be working without technology.

## Goal

For your roboCup sprints you will be setting your own goals that can be completed within a given time (usually two weeks). For our first sprint your goal will be given to you and will be completed in one week.

`Create a design for the tallest possible tower using a single sheet of plain printer paper`

### Restrictions

- No tape, glue, water or other adhesive
- No supports
- Must stand for 30 seconds
- Cutting is allowed
- Normal earth gravity
- Standard paper weight
- sheet size 8.5x11 inches (letter)

You will submit the instructions and diagrams that would allow another to make your designed tower, 

## Process

You will follow the steps outlined below (for both this sprint and those for our RoboCup design).

### Research

I asked Google and chatGpt to give me examples of how to build a paper tower without tape. The general idea is to have a strong base, mainly using triangles.

### Ideation

Here is my first design of the idea and prototype.

### Prototyping

For my first prototype, I decided to cut the paper into 3 pieces and fold each into a triangular prism. In order to stabilise it, I decided to cut little cuts on the top side of the prisms, so it is easier to attach each prism.

### Testing and Critique

This is my first prototype, the tower to stand and seems solid, but

### Final design

You will document your final design idea in detail, with enough technical detail for another engineer to recreate your work

### Conclusion

You will make a brief comment on the success of your design and what next steps others might build on your work.
